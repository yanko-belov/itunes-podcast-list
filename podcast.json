      "description": "This week we are joined by the founder of The Thyroid Health Institute and certified thyroid yogi, functional nutritionist, and lifestyle practitioner, Judith Gonzalez. Judith shares how she reversed her Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis using a unique combination of holistic methods, the shocking discovery she’s made about trauma and thyroid health from years of helping people reduce and eliminate their symptoms, why these conditions mostly affect women, and steps you can take to reduce your thyroid condition-related symptoms by 70-90%, or even reverse them altogether. Delanie also opens up about her own Hashimoto’s diagnosis and what lifestyle changes she implemented as an effective alternative to medication.\n\nFor 65 bonus episodes, exclusive rewards, and to influence content for the show, join our Patreon community: https://www.patreon.com/selfhelpless \n\nDelanie’s free sh*t for mental health professionals: https://www.delaniefischer.com \n\nKelsey’s Tour Dates: https://www.kelseycook.com",

      "description": "This week Delanie, Kelsey, (and Taylor!!!) discuss their decision, and indecision, around having children. They share how they used to feel about this topic 5 years ago when they first started the podcast vs. how they feel now, what experiences and exercises have helped them become more decisive about kids, the variety of FOMO they have, and sooo much more. This is not an episode about the pros and cons of having kids or the selfishness vs. selflessness of either decision. It’s a very honest conversation among women and friends who want the best for each other, and who want to give other people the permission to feel empowered in their own choices. *** If you want children but are struggling to become a parent in one way or another, this episode might not be for you. Our heart goes out to you. \n\nFor 65 bonus episodes, exclusive rewards, and to influence content for the show, join our Patreon community: https://www.patreon.com/selfhelpless \n\nDelanie’s free sh*t for mental health professionals: https://www.delaniefischer.com \n\nKelsey’s Tour Dates: https://www.kelseycook.com\n\nThis episode was sponsored by Helix, Athletic Greens, & Thrive Martket!\n\nHelix is offering up to $200 off all mattress orders AND two free pillows for our listeners at HelixSleep.com/helpless.\n\nAthletic Greens Is going to give you a FREE 1 year supply of immune-supporting Vitamin D AND 5 FREE travel packs with your first purchase.

      "description": "We are joined by Kris Hillberg. Kris opens up about getting married at the age of 21, what led to that decision, and how it impacted her life.Kris is very candid as she shares her personal experience with the organized religion that she grew up in, and her feelings about those experiences. This episode is in no way meant to offend anyone who has religious beliefs - we believe religion can offer community, guidance, and comfort and it can be a very powerful and meaningful part of someone’s life. This episode is not a generalization about religion as a whole, it is one person‘s experience. If you believe you might be upset by hearing someone share about their personal experience relating to religion and no longer being a part of that religion, this episode is not for you. Our goal with this episode is to offer some support, insight, and laughter around this topic for anyone who might be or has been, in a similar situation that Kris was in. Tune in to discover the steps Kris took to pave her own way!\n\nFor 65 bonus episodes, exclusive rewards, and to influence content for the show, join our Patreon community: https://www.patreon.com/selfhelpless\n\nDelanie’s free sh*t for mental health professionals: https://www.delaniefischer.com\n\nKelsey’s Tour Dates: https://www.kelseycook.com\n\nThis episode was sponsored by BetterHelp and Helix!As a listener, you’ll get 10% off your first month by visiting our sponsor at BetterHelp.com/selfhelpless.Helix is offering UP TO 200 dollars off all mattress orders AND two free pillows for our listeners at HelixSleep.com/helpless.",
